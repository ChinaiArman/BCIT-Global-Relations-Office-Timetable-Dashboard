## About the Project

The Timetable Checker Dashboard is a web application that allows users to create and manage timetables for various courses. The application is designed to increase the efficiency of creating timetables by providing a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily add, remove, and modify courses.

This project was developed as part of the COMP 4800 course at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). The project was completed for the BCIT Global Relations Office, which was struggling with the manual process of creating timetables for international students through Excel spreadsheets.
